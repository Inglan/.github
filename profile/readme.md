# ðŸ“œ About Noe Co.
We are a team of three developers looking to find joy in making video games. Currently as of writing, we only have one game in development, called **Expland**, which we plan to be our first game to release to the public. We are putting our heart and soul into this game, and we hope you enjoy it when it comes out. Stay tuned! All of our socials are linked below.
## Meet the team
### Sebastian Suciu (sebashtioon)
>  Seb is a 14 year old in high school who loves messing around with computers and programming languages. His favorite video game is **Geometry Dash**, and the engine he uses to make games is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). He can sometimes be somewhat of a perfectionist, but his friends remind him not to. He has been making games and projects for over 2 years, and he has been loving every second of it. He enjoys playing **Basketball** and sport and is skilled in **GDScript**, **Python** and **C++**.

### Tristan Taylor (GoatsAreTB)
> Tristan is 14 years old and unlike Seb, enjoys making game assets rather than coding, as well as being skilled in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/musicmakers) and paperwork. Tristan is our main source of ideas for the team. He is great at making lore, storyboarding and game planning. He is very enthusiastic about one of our upcoming games, **Expland**, and is putting in a lot of effort into it. His favorite video game is **Subnautica**.
